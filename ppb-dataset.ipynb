Consider the task of facial detection: given an image, is it an image of a face? [Recent work from the MIT Media Lab](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf) showed that this seemingly simple, but extremely important, task is subject to extreme amounts of algorithmic bias among select demographics. [Another report](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6327355) analyzed the face detection system used by the US law enforcement and found that it had significantly lower accuracy among dark skinned women between the age of 18-30 years old. \n\nRun the next code block for a short video from Google that explores how and why it's important to consider bias when thinking about machine learning:","metadata":{"id":"Ag_e7xtTzT1W"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\nYouTubeVideo('59bMh59JQDo')","metadata":{"id":"XQh5HZfbupFF","outputId":"21e28943-d7e8-4ac9-dfad-1b7553b7abd3","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-24T05:11:50.408358Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-24T05:11:50.408868Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-24T05:11:50.578674Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-24T05:11:50.408770Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-24T05:11:50.577383Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this lab, we'll investigate [one recently published approach](http://introtodeeplearning.com/AIES_2019_Algorithmic_Bias.pdf) to addressing algorithmic bias.

2.1 Datasets\n\nWe'll be using three datasets in this lab. In order to train our facial detection models, we'll need a dataset of positive examples (i.e., of faces) and a dataset of negative examples (i.e., of things that are not faces). We'll use these data to train our models to classify images as either faces or not faces. Finally, we'll need a test dataset of face images. Since we're concerned about the potential *bias* of our learned models against certain demographics, it's important that the test dataset we use has equal representation across the demographics or features of interest. In this lab, we'll consider skin tone and gender. \n\n1.   **Positive training data**: [CelebA Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html). A large-scale (over 200K images) of celebrity faces.   \n2.   **Negative training data**: [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/). Many images across many different categories. We'll take negative examples from a variety of non-human categories. \n3. **Test data**: [Pilot Parliaments Benchmark](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf) (PPB). The PPB dataset consists of images of 1270 male and female parliamentarians from various African and European countries and exhibits parity in both skin tone and gender. The gender of each face is annotated with the sex-based \"Male'' and \"Female'' labels.

In order to formalize this, we'll need to think about [*latent variables*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_variable), variables that define a dataset but are not strictly observed. As defined in the generative modeling lecture, we'll use the term *latent space* to refer to the probability distributions of the aforementioned latent variables. Putting these ideas together, we consider a classifier *biased* if its classification decision changes after it sees some additional latent features.

To think about why this may be, consider the dataset the model was trained on, CelebA. If certain features, such as dark skin or hats, are *rare* in CelebA, the model may end up biased against these as a result of training with a biased dataset. That is to say, its classification accuracy will be worse on faces that have under-represented features, such as dark-skinned faces or faces with hats, relevative to faces have features that are well-represented in the training data! This is a problem. \n\nOur goal is to train a *debiased* version of this classifier -- one that accounts for potential disparities in feature representation within the training data. Specifically, to build a debiased facial classifier, we'll train a model that learns a representation of the underlying latent space to the face training data. The model then uses this information to mitigate unwanted biases by sampling faces with rare features, like dark skin or hats, *more frequently* during training. The key design requirement for our model is that it can learn an *encoding* of the latent features in the face data in an entirely *unsupervised* way. To achieve this, we'll turn to variational autoencoders (VAEs).\n\n![The concept of a VAE](http://kvfrans.com/content/images/2016/08/vae.jpg)\n\nAs shown in the schematic above, VAEs rely on an encoder-decoder structure to learn a latent representation of the input data. In the context of computer vision, the encoder network takes in input images, encodes them into a series of variables defined by a mean and standard deviation, and then draws from the distributions defined by these parameters to generate a set of sampled latent variables. The decoder network then \"decodes\" these variables to generate a reconstruction of the original image, which is used during training to help the model identify which latent variables are important to learn. \n\nLet's formalize two key aspects of the VAE model and define relevant functions for each.\n","metadata":{"id":"nLemS7dqECsI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Understanding VAEs: loss function\n\nIn practice, how can we train a VAE?

What this means is that we'll have two terms in our VAE loss function:\n\n1.  **Latent loss ($L_{KL}$)**: measures how closely the learned latent variables match a unit Gaussian and is defined by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.
